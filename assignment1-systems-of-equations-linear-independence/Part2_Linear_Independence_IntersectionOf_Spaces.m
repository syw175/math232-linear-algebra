% Consider the set of vectors in R5: B1 = {w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6} where
w1 = [-1; 1; 2; 4; 1];
w2 = [-1; 1; 2; 1; 1];
w3 = [3; 1; -1; 2; 0];
w4 = [2; 1; 0; 3; -1];
w5 = [5; 4; 1; 11; 3];
w6 = [1; 0; -1; 2; 1];

% Show B1 is a linearly dependent set. Then, demonstrate the conclusion of Theorem
% 1.2.2: Find a maximal linearly independent set B′1
% of vectors from B1, and show that
% the vectors from B1 that are NOT in B′1
% set are contained in the span of B′1
% (and hence, that span B1 = span B′1).

% What is the dimension of span B1?
% Consider the set: B2 = {z1, z2, z3, z4, z5} where
z1 = [5; 2; 1; 7; 1];
z2 = [2; -1; 0; 0; 1];
z3 = [1; 2; 1; 1; 0];
z4 = [2; -4; -2; 4; 1];
z5 = [0; 1; 2; 3; -1];

% Find all the vectors in the intersection span B1 INTERSECTION span B2.
% Show that this is a subspace
