Consider the following picture:


Find the matrix that transforms the black rectangle into the red rectangle. Look at
the diagram and observe what has happened to the black rectangle. Form the matrices
that do these operations; there are two. Multiply these matrices in the correct order
to get the transformation matrix A. Experimentally verify that you can plot the black
rectangle yourself and then multiply the vectors that describe the opposite vertices by
A and obtain and plot the red rectangle. Include the matrices you used to do this in
your report.
